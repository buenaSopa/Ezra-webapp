### **Terminology for ad script**

**Concept**

A broad theme or category of the problem or benefit we are targeting. This is the foundation around which creative is built. It answers the question: *What is the core problem or topic we're addressing?*

Example: **Detanning**, **Hairfall**, **Acne Scars**, **Slow Shipping**

**Angle**

A specific context or scenario within the concept that makes the messaging hyper-relevant. It answers: *For whom, when, or where does this problem matter most?*

Example: **Detanning for an upcoming wedding**, **Hairfall caused by stress during exams**, **Acne scars for young professionals preparing for job interviews**, **Slow shipping frustrations for last-minute festival shoppers in Mumbai**

**Ad Type**

The creative execution format. How the idea is visually and narratively presented.

Examples: **UGC Testimonial**, **Founder-led Story**, **Problem-Solution Demo**, **Before-After Showcase**, **Comparison Ad**

**Iterations**

Small tweaks made to the same angle or script to refine messaging, phrasing, or delivery without changing the angle or concept.

Example: Testing three different CTAs at the end of the same script or testing three different Hook for the same scripts. 

**Variations**

Different executions of the same concept but with distinct angles or different creative formats.

Example: Running **Detanning for weddings** in a high-production founder video and **Detanning for post-vacation recovery** as a UGC testimonial.
