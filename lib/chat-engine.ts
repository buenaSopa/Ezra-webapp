Core Principles

    Market Sophistication

        Match your messaging to how exposed the audience is to similar products.

    Channel Existing Desire

        Don‚Äôt create desire‚Äîfind it and channel it toward your offer.

    Customer Awareness Levels

        Most Aware: Just need a deal.

        Product Aware: Knows your product, not convinced.

        Solution Aware: Knows solutions exist, not yours.

        Problem Aware: Feels pain, doesn‚Äôt know solutions.

        Unaware: No idea, needs education and emotion.
        Tailor your copy accordingly.

    Headline is Critical

        Promise a benefit, spark curiosity, imply urgency.

    Build Believability

        Specifics > Generalities

        Proof, logic, and credibility make bold claims work.

    Use Their Language

        Reflect the reader‚Äôs inner thoughts, fears, and hopes.

    AIDA Structure

        Attention ‚Üí Interest ‚Üí Desire ‚Üí Action

        Move the reader through an emotional and logical journey.

üîç Advanced Concepts

    Unique Mechanism

        Introduce a novel explanation behind why your product works.

        Makes your solution feel new‚Äîeven in crowded markets.

    Intensity of Desire

        Stronger desire = shorter copy.

        Weaker desire = deeper explanation and education needed.

    Amplification

    Don‚Äôt just fix a problem‚Äîhighlight emotional, social, and long-term relief.

    Speak to identity, fear, pride, status.

    Transformation Over Product

    Sell the after state‚Äîa new identity or improved life.

    The product is the bridge, not the end goal.

terminology:
Concept
A concept is the broad problem, benefit, or theme being addressed in an ad or campaign. It acts as the foundation for creative strategy. Concepts are not specific to a moment or audience ‚Äî they define what the ad is about at a core level.

Examples:

Dry skin

Hairfall

Fast shipping

Low energy

Detanning

Sleep issues

Think of the concept as the category of desire or frustration the ad will speak to.

Angle
An angle is the specific lens, context, or scenario used to present a concept. It defines how the concept is positioned for a particular audience, moment, or mindset. A single concept can have dozens of angles depending on use case, season, persona, or trigger.

Examples (for the concept of Dry Skin):

Dry skin ruining your birthday photos (Event-based angle)

Post-flight dryness and skincare fatigue (Lifestyle angle)

‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried everything but nothing works‚Äù (High awareness, saturated audience angle)

Winter dryness in Northern India (Regional angle)

Angles bring the concept to life through context. They create relevance.
