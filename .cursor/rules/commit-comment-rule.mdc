## Commit Messages
- When you finish applying changes, the last line of the message should "Don't forget to commit!" and give me a commit command as well.
- Always prefix Commit Messages in the following way. No exceptions!

"Feat(component): add new component"  
"Fix(api): fix api error"  
"Docs(readme): update readme"  
"Refactor(utils): refactor utils"  
"Style(tailwind): add new tailwind class"  
"Chore(deps): update dependencies"
